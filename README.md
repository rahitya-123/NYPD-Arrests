###NYPD Arrests
In this project, I build an ETL Pipeline for NYPD Arrest Data using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI.

I start with extracting the data from NYC Open Data API, then perform some transformations, do data validation, and then, finally load it into SQL Server.

In SQL server, I perform some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to answer some questions. Finally, I also connect SQL Server to Power BI to gather some further detailed insights.
